        <h2> What is CahootBet?</h2>
		<p>The gambling industry has long been a lucrative market, with billions of dollars generated annually.<br> 
        Cahootbet is pleased to present a revolutionary investment opportunity in the form of the <br> 
        proprietary $cahoot token, which provides token holders with an 80% share of all casino-generated revenue. <br>
        This whitepaper outlines the details of our investment opportunity and the development plans for our online casino.</p>
        <h2> Investment Opportunity</h2>
        <p>The $cahoot token is a unique investment opportunity that provides token holders with an 80% share<br> 
         of all casino-generated revenue. Of the total revenue generated, 40% will be paid out as weekly dividends<br> 
          to token holders. This means that if the casino earns $10 million per day, a token holder owning 1% of the <br> 
          tokens would receive $280,000 per week. The remaining 40% will be allocated towards buying back tokens, <br> 
          resulting in constant buy pressure. These tokens will be permanently burned, increasing the value of the <br> 
          remaining tokens for token holders. The remaining 20% of revenue will be allocated towards the development <br> 
          of cahootbet.com</p>
        <h2> Development Plans</h2>
        <p>Our company is committed to developing an innovative online gambling platform that offers top-notch slots<br>  
        and a sportsbook. During the alpha launch, we will only provide a few simple games to demonstrate proof of <br> 
        concept. We believe that a successful online casino should have the latest games, excellent customer service, <br> 
        and a user-friendly interface. We will be working on developing partnerships with the top game providers in <br> 
        the industry to provide our players with the best games. We believe that it is essential to be transparent with<br> 
        our investors and players. As such, we will make all financial data available to token holders, including revenue <br> 
        generated, dividends paid out, and the number of tokens bought back and burned.
        <h2> Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to be the most innovative online gambling platform available, with a unique practice of distributing <br> 
        profits to valued token holders. The $cahoot token investment opportunity provides an opportunity for investors to<br> 
        participate in the lucrative online gambling industry while receiving weekly dividends and participating in the <br> 
        growth of the company. Our team is committed to developing an exceptional online casino that offers the latest<br> 
         games and excellent customer service. We believe that our commitment to transparency and innovative practices<br> 
          will set us apart in the industry and create long-term value for our investors. <br> 
         The $cahoot token is an ERC-20 governance token that features a capped supply of 10 million tokens, which will <br> 
         ensure its scarcity and consequent value appreciation over time. Of the total token supply, 20% will be retained <br> 
         by the development team to facilitate continued website improvement and maintenance to provide players with the <br> 
         best possible gaming experience. The remaining 80% of tokens will be made available to the public upon launch, <br> 
         providing investors with an opportunity to participate in the lucrative online gambling industry while also gaining<br> 
          a stake in the development and growth of our platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
